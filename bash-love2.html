		<div class="expandme">
			<p>Bash is a scripting language and a Unix shell. Unix is a command line interpreter (also called a shell), which takes commands input by the user and turns them into actions the computer performs. Bash is a language that combines three older shell scripts: Bourne, sh, csh, and ksh.</p>

			<p>With bash you have the power to access files (directories), create new ones, and make new files within them. You can also open those files to edit them. Bash is an incredibly powerful scripting language. This is just barely scratching the surface, but once you get used to these commands, you can move on to more advanced things. No matter what you do, you look cool doing it.</p>

			<p>This is an introduction to Bash and some of the basic commands you can use to get started in the format of a love letter.</p>

		<p>Dear Bash,</p> 
		<p>I still remember the day we first met. There you were, dressed in black in front of me. I felt my heart flutter as you blinked patiently waiting for me to say something. Maybe I was intimidated by what you can do, but possibly because I felt that together we could explore the vast and infinite corners of the digital world (if it has corners). I didn’t know if I should feel terrified or excited. As I typed my first message to you “echo “Hello!”” and you replied without hesitation “Hello,” I knew this would be the start of something beautiful. </p>

		<p>We have grown much since those novel days. Now, I can’t say that I am completely at ease when I talk to you, but I’d like to think that we understand each other in a way that no one else has understood me. We have our ups and downs and I have found that you are very straightforward. If I say “mdir” instead of “mkdir” you’re quick to reply with: “command not found.” Sometimes I wish you would explain yourself more, but love is a constant balancing act. No one said it was supposed to be easy. But I’m learning to love you in so many new ways. I need to pour all of these things out on paper because if I hold them in any longer, I am going to explode.</p>

		<ul class="listing">
			<li>I say “pwd” (present working directory) and you give me a path of the current folder I am in.</li>
			<li>I say “ls” (list) and you display a list of the files in the current directory.</li>
			<li>I say “cd” and you change the directory to the path I specify. Sometimes I have to drag the path to you because I can’t be bothered to type out all of the slashes.</li>
			<li>With “cd &sim;” you take me to the user directory.</li>
			<li>With “cd /” I am sent to the root folder (of love).</li>
			<li>With “mkdir” and the filename, we make sweet, sweet folders in the “pwd”.</li>
			<li>When I “touch” you and give you a file name, you make a beautiful new file. That’s the most fun.</li>
			<li>“nano” opens your text editor so I can touch up a file and make it better. For us. </li>
			<li>Sometimes I don’t want to read a lot, so I open a short file with “cat” which stands for concatenate. It’s silly to use such a long word for such a short command.</li>
			<li>When I want to read more, I ask for “less” and use the spacebar to flip from page to page of long documents. You try to be funny, and it’s so cute.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>That’s all that I know to say to you. We don’t speak much, but I wish we did. There is so much we can do together. I know you just wait for me to talk to you, but sometimes I wish you would reach out to me.</p>

			<p>Much love,</p>
